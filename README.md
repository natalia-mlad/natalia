# natalia

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to support me (Natalia) with my various Data
Science tasks. In practice, this is just an eclectic collection of
personal functions that I keep on coming back to. In the future, some of
the functions might get migrated to their own niche packages where Iâ€™m
sure theyâ€™ll feel more at home!

<!--# TODO: add a hex sticker to left of this intro {hexSticker} -->

## Installation

You can install `natalia` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("natalia-mlad/natalia")
```

## Examples

<!-- (maybe further broken down by usecases) -->

Here are some basic examples of how to use the functions found in this
package:

``` r
library(natalia)
```

-   ID ordinal variables from numeric ones

The following example is based on a cut-off point of 5, the max number
of levels allowed for the variable before it stops being considered
ordinal and becomes continuous.

``` r
isOrd(mtcars, n = 5)
#> [1] "cyl"  "vs"   "am"   "gear"
```

-   Polytomize item data

For instance, you could simplify Likert item data into three categories
for reporting or to use in further modeling.

``` r
responses <- data.frame(
  item1 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = TRUE),
  item2 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = TRUE),
  item3 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = TRUE)
)
head(responses)
#>   item1 item2 item3
#> 1     3     1     3
#> 2     5     6     6
#> 3     7     2     2
#> 4     5     2     2
#> 5     2     5     7
#> 6     1     6     7
```

``` r
polytomize_data(responses, thresholds = c(3,4)) %>%
  head()
#> [33mi[39m Turning data into 3 categories.
#>   item1 item2 item3
#> 1     1     1     1
#> 2     3     3     3
#> 3     3     1     1
#> 4     3     1     1
#> 5     1     3     3
#> 6     1     3     3
```

-   Scrape duckduckgo search results

This is useful for comparing top results and their sentiment across
search enginges.

``` r
duckduckgo(c("personal", "data", "privacy")) %>%
  head()

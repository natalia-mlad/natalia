# natalia

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to support me with my various Data Science
tasks.

In practice, this is just an eclectic collection of personal functions
that I keep on coming back to. In the future, some of the functions
might get migrated to their own niche packages where Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll
feel more at home!

<!--# TODO: add a hex sticker to left of this intro {hexSticker} -->

## Installation

You can install `natalia` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("natalia-mlad/natalia")
```

## Examples

<!-- (maybe further broken down by usecases) -->

Here are some basic examples of how to use the functions found in this
package:

``` r
library(natalia)
```

-   ID ordinal variables from numeric ones

The following example is based on a cut-off point of 5, the max number
of levels allowed for the variable before it stops being considered
ordinal and becomes continuous.

``` r
isOrd(mtcars, n = 5)
#> [1] "cyl"  "vs"   "am"   "gear"
```

-   Polytomize item data

For instance, you could simplify Likert item data into three categories
for reporting or to use in further modeling.

``` r
responses <- data.frame(
  item1 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = TRUE),
  item2 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = TRUE),
  item3 = sample(1:7, 50, replace = TRUE)
)
head(responses)
#>   item1 item2 item3
#> 1     6     3     6
#> 2     4     1     1
#> 3     3     7     2
#> 4     5     5     6
#> 5     1     4     1
#> 6     6     3     5
```

``` r
polytomize_data(responses, thresholds = c(3,4)) %>%
  head()
#> [33mi[39m Turning data into 3 categories.
#>   item1 item2 item3
#> 1     3     1     3
#> 2     2     1     1
#> 3     1     3     1
#> 4     3     3     3
#> 5     1     2     1
#> 6     3     1     3
```

-   Scrape duckduckgo search results

This is useful for comparing top results and their sentiments across
queries or search enginges.
